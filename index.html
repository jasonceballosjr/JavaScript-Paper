                -----To me, JavaScript is a scripting language that we use to program websites. While JavaScript is not
                what
                makes the website pretty, nor does it create the space for the elements to exist, it does make other
                aspects on the website do pretty neat things. I’ve come to realize that JavaScript is the most used
                language in the world when it comes to web development, but at the same time, JavaScript is just the
                base. There are libraries that exist (React, Vue, Angular) that extend the capabilities of JavaScript.
                Lastly, JavaScript can do interesting things like store variables, create functions, and do amazing
                things like implement Geolocation API to track your location continuously.
            </p>
            <p>
                -----To relate JavaScript to HTML (Hyper-text Markup Language), we can link them with the
                <.script> tag! This allows the HTML to “talk” to the JavaScript, and vice versa.After doing this, we can
                    implement interesting effects that have an almost immeasurable range.Some things that can be done
                    are tracking location, making buttons move around the screen, do very interesting scroll effects,
                    create very useful and stylish navigation bars; the options are literally endless! Some of my
                    favorite things about HTML being paired with JavaScript is the fact that websites that use HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript wouldn’t be visually anything without HTML creating the link that connects them.
            </p>
            <p>
                -----CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) in my opinion is the easiest “language” to pick up.The structure is
                fairly straight - forward! We can link CSS to JavaScript by having HTML as the bridge between them;
                the “middle - man”.CSS needs to be linked in the head element of HTML using the < link> tag, and
                    from there(assuming JavaScript is also connected), we can relate JavaScript and CSS.To explain
                    this relationship, I will use a square as an example.HTML can create the space for the square by
                    using the < div> tag.CSS can make this square blue, or any other color we want.However,
                        JavaScript can make this blue square into a button, a clickable link, the head of a snake in
                        the Snake Game.

                -----An analogy that really helped me understand the difference between all of them and their
                capabilities was with anatomy.HTML is the skeletal structure(or bones) of it all, while
                JavaScript is the muscles, allowing things to move and do tricks.Lastly, CSS is the skin of
                it all, making us(or it) pretty and approachable.Who would want to shake hands with a bare
                muscle, no - skin havin’ goon.
            </p>
            -----To end this, a variable is created by using 1 of 3 declaring types.Var, let, or const.Var
            and let are the same thing, where they can change! Const is different, where it is short for
            constant, which means that this variable cannot be changed or altered after being
            declared.The variable itself defines the name of that variable to be something, while other
            functions in the program will use that very same name to use it’s stored data to do
            things.After using var, let, or const ; there are different data types! These data types can
            be null, string, number, float, undefined, boolean.There are many more, but these are the
            basics!
